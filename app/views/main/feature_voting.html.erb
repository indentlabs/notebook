            Voting will end at noon UTC on May 31, 2017. At that time, the feature with the most votes will "win" and will be included in a feature release shortly after.

          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            When you sign up for a Premium subscription, you are given one vote to cast however you'd like. Whenever you <%= link_to 'refer a friend to Notebook.ai', friends_landing_path %> that signs up for Premium, you'll automatically be given two more feature votes (and an extra one for your friend).

          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">help_outline</i>What will happen to the ideas that don't win?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            Based on voting, the other features will be prioritized accordingly. If two features are neck-and-neck, you can expect to see the runner-up make it into a future feature update sooner rather than later, but only the winning feature is guaranteed to be released first after voting.
