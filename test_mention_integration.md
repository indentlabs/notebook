# Testing @mention Integration in Documents

## Setup Complete ✅

The @mention system has been successfully integrated into the documents editor. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Frontend Integration
- ✅ Wrapped the editor div with Alpine component `x-data="contentLinking()"`
- ✅ Added `x-ref="editor"` to the editor element
- ✅ Included the dropdown partial for displaying mention suggestions
- ✅ Added helper tooltip "Press @ to link other pages"

### 2. Content Handling for Medium Editor
- ✅ Updated `selectItem()` method to handle contenteditable with Medium Editor
- ✅ Properly inserts `[[ContentType-ID]]` tokens maintaining cursor position
- ✅ Triggers Medium Editor's input events for proper state management

### 3. Autosave Integration
- ✅ Updated `triggerAutosave()` to call document's `queueAutosave()` function
- ✅ Triggers Medium Editor's `editableInput` event
- ✅ Ensures changes are saved after inserting mentions

### 4. Backend Processing (Already Existed)
- ✅ `DocumentMentionJob` processes `[[ContentType-ID]]` tokens
- ✅ Creates `DocumentEntity` records for linked pages
- ✅ Linked pages appear in entities sidebar

## How to Test

1. **Open a document for editing**
   - Go to `/documents/[id]/edit`

2. **Test @mention dropdown**
   - Type `@` in the editor
   - Dropdown should appear with categorized content (Characters, Locations, etc.)
   - Type to filter results
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Enter or click to select

3. **Verify token insertion**
   - Selected item should insert `[[ContentType-ID]]` format
   - Cursor should be positioned after the inserted token
   - Document should autosave after insertion

4. **Check linked pages**
   - After save, click "Entities" button in toolbar
   - Linked pages should appear in the sidebar
   - These are created by `DocumentMentionJob` processing the tokens

## Expected Behavior

- When typing `@`, a dropdown appears with all available content
- Typing after `@` filters the results
- Selecting an item inserts `[[Character-123]]` style token
- The token is processed on save and creates a linked page
- Linked pages appear in the entities sidebar for quick reference

## Token Format

The system uses the format: `[[ContentType-ID]]`
- Example: `[[Character-42]]`, `[[Location-123]]`, `[[Item-456]]`
- These tokens are replaced with styled links when the document is displayed
- The DocumentMentionJob processes these tokens to create document entities
