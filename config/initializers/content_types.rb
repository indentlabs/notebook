# TODO: We should probably migrate towards using string names instead of actual class references (like we
# do below) so we can make sure they're always available (e.g. metaprogramming on class definitions).
# Otherwise, we're loading these classes into memory before this initializer (and/or other initializers)
# have run. See HasPageReferences for an example of why we needed content_type_names instead of content_types.
